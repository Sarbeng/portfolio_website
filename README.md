# portfolio_website
I built my portfolio in react and an api to laravel. I wanted to use this as a way to get better at both react interface design and api development

To be honest, i was frustrated and just wanted to work on something

# Things i am hoping to work on?
1. Blog
2. Design Ecommerce
3. Drag and Drop Features
4. React Components that others can download and use
5. Wedding Invitation Designs with PSD downloadables
